 + Cartonization  This workflow is called during the process of outbound order from desktop or action. Its goal to take in order lines to determine what are the container the materials will fit in 
 + Entity Status Change (Before Commit) The workk horse of the workflows, this embedded workflow is triggered when the enity (order, shipment , task) changed it status like processing to complete. This allows this to be added like accesorial charges or other entities or do what ever is needed 
 + Message Controller This workflow is called from many context in the mobile. It can with these context provide the detials of a message it should display to the user at that point. Often used to notify the user to do some additional work at receiving or pick  or various other points.

The workflow is used often to determine is the order lines can be fulfilled, or to create a new shipment and break up the order lines for a back order case. This is sometimes used to change the orderline or make sub lines used to handle material subsitution and so on. 
 + Recommended Inventory Location Given to this workflow is the current LP and inventory on that plate. With this its job it to return a License Plate and Location that this inventory should be moved to. 
 + Recommended License Plate Location Given to this workflow is the current LP. With this its job it to return a Location that this inventory should be moved to.
